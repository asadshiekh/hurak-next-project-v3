                            Hurak.com is an education technology platform that allows educators to create and share educational content. Our platform hosts a wide variety of courses

                            We do not tolerate infringing activity on or through our platform. Because we operate on a marketplace model, we do not review or edit content for legal issues, nor can we determine its legality. However, Hurak is dedicated to upholding the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. When course providers upload content to Hurak, they commit to having the necessary rights or permissions to use that content.
                        </p>

                            This policy details our process for managing copyright takedown notices from content owners and trademark takedown notices from trademark owners concerning content on our platform. It also outlines our actions when Hurak providers' courses are replicated on third-party platforms without their consent.
